    "### Game\n",
    "\n",
    "The game was made in the style of a platformer. The inspiration was the game named \"Celeste\". The game allows you to choose a hero and embark on a journey through an unknown land.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Gameplay\n",
    "\n",
    "As noted above, the style of play is platformer. So the gameplay is very obvious and has a linear meaning.\n",
    "You must select one on an existing hero, and as a bonus, you can set the starting hero's **health points**.\n",
    "\n",
    "After starting the game, you have to collect the maximum possible amount of **fruit** without dying. In parallel with the collection of fruits on your way there will be enemies and obstacles in the form of a burning fire, which you need to either bypass or fight (only works with the enemy, not with fire).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instructions for controlling the hero:**\n",
    "1. Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to walk;\n",
    "2. For a normal jump, press once on the space bar, for a double jump, press twice on the space bar;\n",
    "3. To accelerate, press button A;\n",
    "4. To protect yourself from enemies, so as not to receive damage, press the P button;\n",
    "5. To attack the enemy, press the T button;\n",
    "6. In order to collect the fruit you need to collide with it;\n",
    "7. Picking fruit increases health points by 20;\n",
    "8. When colliding with a monster, 10 health points are taken away;\n",
    "9. When colliding with a fire, 1 health point is taken away.\n",
    "\n",
    "**General remarks:**\n",
    "- At the beginning of the game, you can choose one of four heroes and determine the level of health points from 50 to 200 inclusive.\n",
    "- Statistics during the game such as health points, collected fruits and defeated enemies will be displayed in the upper left corner.\n",
    "- After completing the game, you will have access to general statistics on the number of fruits collected and enemies defeated.\n",
    "\n",
    "**_Good luck in the game and collecting fruits._**"

    "The main principle on which the game is built is the use of **object-oriented programming**, the **pygame library** and pre-prepared images based on which the animation will be created.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to create a hero, monster, fruit and any other object, object-oriented programming was used, because. classes and their inheritance are ideal for creating attributes of each element and game and using it in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, because we have a game in the style of a platformer, it is very practical to make a parent class of the object type with basic parameters from which in the future to create several inheriting classes with slight differences in attributes, because for this there is inheritance and a class constructor that allows you to flexibly create, manage and receive the value of those objects needed during the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **pygame** library took on a major role in the creation of the game, as it contains the basic entities, on the basis of which you can create everything that we enter. The main element in the library is a **Sprite**, which we can use based on the idea of the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Going through the steps more clearly:\n",
    "1. The paygame library was used as the basis for creating and rendering all game elements;\n",
    "2. The principle of object-oriented programming helped in code optimization and more convenient management of game objects:\n",
    "    * The hero class defines the main attributes, such as the location of the hero, his speed, health points, etc.\n",
    "    * Functions have been implemented to allow him to move, accelerate, defend, attack, collect fruit, etc.\n",
    "3. Pre-prepared character images are perfect for character animation"
